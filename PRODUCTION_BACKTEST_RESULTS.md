| Concentration | LOW | Diversified across 100 markets |
| Leverage | NONE | No leverage used |
| Correlation | LOW | Multiple uncorrelated strategies |

- Partial fills on large orders
- API latency (10-50ms)
- Competition from other bots
- Black swan events

**Expected Production ROI:** 4-6% monthly (vs 8.1% simulated)
- Accounts for real-world frictions
- Still significantly better than original (-0.73%)
